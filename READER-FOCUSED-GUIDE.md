# Reader-Focused Writing Transformation

## Core Principle

Per [Google's documentation style](https://developers.google.com/style/person): Use "you" instead of "we/our/us". Focus on what the reader gets, not what you built.

## Transformation Rules

| Writer-Focused ❌ | Reader-Focused ✅ |
|------------------|------------------|
| We built a tool that | You can |
| This provides X capability | You'll get X benefit |
| The stack reduces costs | Your costs will decrease |
| It offers integration | You'll integrate |
| We validated X | X works for your tasks |
| Our tool has features | You get features |
| This shows | You'll see |
| We recommend | Use this when |

**After**: "Reduce your Claude Code costs by 79.5%"

### Feature Descriptions

**Before**: "AuZoom provides progressive code navigation with three disclosure levels"
**After**: "You can read code at three detail levels - skeleton for structure, summary for understanding, full for editing"

### Results

**Before**: "We achieved 79.5% cost reduction through validation"
**After**: "Your costs drop 79.5% on routine development tasks"

### Instructions

**Before**: "Users should install the prerequisites first"
**After**: "Install these prerequisites before starting"

## Key Patterns

### Start with Outcomes

**Bad**: "We implemented a caching system that improves performance"
**Good**: "Your repeated file reads run 100x faster"

### Use Active Voice for Reader

**Bad**: "Token reduction is achieved through progressive disclosure"
**Good**: "You'll use 23% fewer tokens with progressive file reading"

### Problem → Solution

**Bad**: "This tool addresses high API costs"
**Good**: "Your API costs drop from $X to $Y"

## When "We" is OK

Per [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/person): Use "we" only when referring to the organization as document author.

**Acceptable**: "We validated these claims through 25 development tasks"
**Better**: "These claims come from 25 validated development tasks"
