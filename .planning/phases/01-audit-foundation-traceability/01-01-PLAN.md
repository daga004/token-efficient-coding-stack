<objective>
Reconstruct WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md to establish traceability between original promises and actual delivery.

Purpose: Create missing documentation that maps V1 implementation requirements to what was actually built, identifying gaps where promises weren't delivered.

Output: Comprehensive WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md with promise-to-delivery mapping and gap identification.

**Known context:**
- WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md was referenced in validation plans but never created
- Need to reconstruct original requirements from archived PROJECT.md and phase plans
- Validation plans (03-01, 03-02) reference "original wishlist" targets

**Constraining decisions:**
- Audit as evidence-based: Every finding documented with file references
- Fix-implementation-first: Gaps are implementation failures, not documentation issues

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Scan all phase plans and summaries for requirement references</name>
  <files>.planning/WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md (new)</files>
  <action>
    Grep through .planning/phases/*/PLAN.md and *-SUMMARY.md for references to:
    - "wishlist", "requirement", "target", "goal", "promise"
    - Lines like "Success Targets", "Original targets", "from wishlist"

    Extract quoted requirements and targets. Parse PROJECT-v1-implementation to identify:
    - Active requirements (what was supposed to be built)
    - Success criteria from validation plans
    - Any "≥X%" or numerical targets mentioned

    Compile comprehensive list of all promises/requirements referenced in V1 planning.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -r "wishlist\|requirement\|target" .planning/phases/ returns matches; extracted list contains validation targets (≥50% tokens, ≥70% cost)</verify>
  <done>Complete list of V1 promises extracted with file:line references for each</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Map promises to actual delivery status</name>
  <files>.planning/WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md</files>
  <action>
    For each extracted promise/requirement, determine delivery status:

    1. **Delivered**: Evidence in summaries that requirement was met
       - Check VALIDATION-REPORT.md for metrics
       - Check phase summaries for features implemented
       - Note: Evidence file and line number

    2. **Partially Delivered**: Feature exists but doesn't meet stated criteria
       - Example: "Token reduction ≥50%" but only works on large files
       - Document: What was delivered vs what was promised

    3. **Not Delivered**: No evidence of implementation
       - Example: Missing WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md itself
       - Document: Where promise appeared, why it matters

    4. **Deferred to V2**: Explicitly moved out of scope
       - Check Out of Scope sections in PROJECT.md
       - Verify deferral was documented (not forgotten)

    Create mapping table: Promise | Status | Evidence | Gap Description
  </action>
  <verify>Each promise has status assignment; "Not Delivered" items have gap descriptions; all references include file:line evidence</verify>
  <done>Complete mapping of 100% of extracted promises to delivery status with evidence</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md with structured findings</name>
  <files>.planning/WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md</files>
  <action>
    Write comprehensive compliance document with structure:

    ```markdown
    # V1 Implementation Compliance Report

    ## Metadata
    - Generated: [date]
    - Source: Reconstruction from phase plans and archived PROJECT.md
    - Coverage: All referenced requirements in .planning/phases/

    ## Summary Statistics
    - Total promises: X
    - Delivered: X (X%)
    - Partially delivered: X (X%)
    - Not delivered: X (X%)
    - Properly deferred: X (X%)

    ## Promise-to-Delivery Mapping

    ### Delivered (Evidence-Backed)
    | Promise | Source | Evidence | Notes |
    |---------|--------|----------|-------|
    | Token reduction ≥50% | phases/03-*/PLAN.md:28 | VALIDATION-REPORT.md:145 (23% actual) | Underdelivered on target |

    ### Not Delivered (Gaps)
    | Promise | Source | Gap Description | Severity |
    |---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
    | WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md traceability | phases/03-01-PLAN.md:25 | Document never created | High - No accountability |

    ### Properly Deferred (V2)
    | Promise | Deferral Documentation | Legitimacy Assessment |
    |---------|------------------------|----------------------|
    | Evolving-memory integration | PROJECT.md:33 | Legitimate - separate concern |

    ## Critical Gaps Requiring Action
    [List gaps that break core assumptions or promises]

    ## Audit Recommendations
    [Next steps for gap remediation]
    ```

    Use actual data from tasks 1-2. Include all file:line references. Be brutally honest about underdelivery.
  </action>
  <verify>WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md exists; contains all extracted promises; all claims have file:line evidence; gap descriptions are specific</verify>
  <done>Document complete, committed, provides full traceability for audit verification</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md file exists
- [ ] All promises from phase plans included
- [ ] Every entry has source file:line reference
- [ ] Gap descriptions are specific and actionable
- [ ] Statistics add up correctly
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All 3 tasks completed
- WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md provides full promise-to-delivery traceability
- No referenced requirements missing from document
- Evidence citations enable verification
- Critical gaps clearly identified
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-audit-foundation-traceability/01-01-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 1 Plan 01: WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE Reconstruction Summary

**Reconstructed V1 traceability document mapping [X] promises to delivery status with evidence**

## Accomplishments

- Scanned [X] phase plans and summaries for requirement references
- Mapped [X] promises to delivery status (Delivered/Partial/Not Delivered/Deferred)
- Created comprehensive WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md with file:line evidence
- Identified [X] critical gaps requiring remediation

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md` - V1 compliance report with promise-to-delivery mapping

## Decisions Made

None - document reconstruction task

## Issues Encountered

[Problems during reconstruction, or "None"]

## Next Step

Ready for 01-02-PLAN.md (audit infrastructure)
