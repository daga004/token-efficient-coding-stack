<objective>
Assess validation methodology for biases, errors, and appropriateness to determine if measurement approach is sound.

Purpose: Identify any systematic issues in how metrics were measured that could inflate/deflate results regardless of actual performance.
Output: Methodology assessment report and Phase 5 synthesis with overall verdict on validation legitimacy.

**Key methodology questions:**
- Was baseline fair? (Always Sonnet appropriate, or should some tasks use Opus?)
- Were optimized costs real or theoretical? (Gemini Flash integration status)
- Was token counting accurate or estimated?
- Were quality assessments objective or subjective?
- Was test suite representative? (10 simple + 15 challenging = realistic workload?)
- Were task descriptions biased toward system strengths?

**From STATE.md:**
- Gemini Flash integration theoretical (not actual API execution) - Phase 6 to fix
- Small file overhead not handled (auto-detect threshold missing)
- Need to assess: Do methodology flaws invalidate validation?

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Identify measurement methodology biases</name>
  <files>audit/reports/05-04-methodology-assessment.md</files>
  <action>Systematic methodology audit covering all potential bias sources:

## 1. Baseline Fairness Assessment

**Question:** Was using Sonnet universally for baseline appropriate?
- Check if any simple tasks (0.5-3.0 complexity) should have used Haiku in baseline
- Check if any critical tasks (8.0+ complexity) should have used Opus in baseline
- Calculate "fair baseline" where baseline also uses appropriate model routing
- Compare: Claimed 79.5% savings vs fair-baseline savings
- **Verdict:** BASELINE FAIR / BASELINE INFLATED / BASELINE DEFLATED

## 2. API Execution Reality Check

**Question:** Were optimized costs based on real API calls or theoretical calculations?
- Review Phase 3 validation methodology (03-02-SUMMARY.md)
- Check if Gemini Flash costs used actual gemini CLI or theoretical pricing
- Check if Claude costs used actual anthropic SDK or theoretical pricing
- Identify which costs were real vs estimated
- **Verdict:** REAL API EXECUTION / MIXED (some theoretical) / FULLY THEORETICAL

## 3. Token Counting Accuracy

**Question:** Were tokens counted from actual API responses or estimated?
- Check if baseline used actual Read tool token consumption or estimated
- Check if optimized used actual auzoom_read token consumption or estimated
- Review token estimation methodology (lines × 4 chars/line ÷ 4)
- Validate against real API usage.input_tokens from Phase 5 evidence
- **Verdict:** ACCURATE COUNTING / ESTIMATION ERRORS / SYSTEMATIC BIAS

## 4. Quality Assessment Objectivity

**Question:** Were quality scores objective or subjective?
- Review quality scoring methodology (functional equivalence validation)
- Check if quality was verified with actual execution or code inspection
- Identify any tasks where quality assessment could be subjective
- **Verdict:** OBJECTIVE SCORING / SOME SUBJECTIVITY / SYSTEMATIC BIAS

## 5. Test Suite Representativeness

**Question:** Does 25-task suite represent realistic workload distribution?
- Claimed: 60-70% simple tasks in real work
- Test suite: 10/25 simple (40%), 15/25 challenging (60%)
- This skews toward challenging tasks (inflates difficulty perception)
- Recalculate metrics with realistic 70/30 distribution
- **Verdict:** REPRESENTATIVE / SKEWED TOWARD CHALLENGING / SKEWED TOWARD SIMPLE

## 6. Task Description Bias

**Question:** Were tasks designed to favor system strengths?
- Check if tasks emphasize dependency graphs (AuZoom strength)
- Check if tasks emphasize model routing (Orchestrator strength)
- Identify tasks where traditional approach might excel
- **Verdict:** NEUTRAL DESIGN / BIASED TOWARD SYSTEM / BIASED AGAINST SYSTEM

# Phase 5: Validation Metrics Re-execution - Synthesis

## Executive Summary

**Overall Verdict:** METRICS VALIDATED / PARTIALLY VALIDATED / METRICS REFUTED

**One-liner:** [Concise finding about whether published metrics are legitimate]

## Key Findings

### 1. Cost Savings Claim (79.5%)
- Claimed: 79.5% cost savings (Claude-only routing)
- Actual (from real APIs): [X]%
- Discrepancy: [X] percentage points
- Verdict: VALIDATED / REFUTED / NEEDS REVISION
- Explanation: [Why - methodology issues, real vs theoretical, etc.]

### 2. Token Savings Claim (23%)
- Claimed: 23% token savings (acknowledged below 50% target)
- Actual (from real APIs): [X]%
- Discrepancy: [X] percentage points
- Verdict: VALIDATED / REFUTED / NEEDS REVISION
- Explanation: [Why]

### 3. Quality Claims
- Simple tasks (100% claimed): [X]% actual
- Challenging tasks (67% claimed): [X]% actual
