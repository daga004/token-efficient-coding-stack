- 25 validation tasks executed (10 simple, 15 challenging)
- Honest analysis published (80-85% success realistic)
- Reader-focused README.md

### Recent Work: README.md Reader-Focused Rewrite (Complete)

**Completed**: README.md transformed to reader-focused style
- ✅ Changed "We built X" → "You'll save X"
- ✅ Changed Features → Benefits
- ✅ Changed "The stack provides" → "You can/You'll get"
- ✅ Removed Flash-based claims (moved to roadmap)
- ✅ Restored AuZoom description as "progressive discovery of context"
- ✅ Updated all cost savings to Claude-only (79.5%)
- ✅ Removed unvalidated annual projections (needs proper subscription cost analysis)

**Files Transformed**:
1. ✅ README.md (complete - reader-focused style)
2. ✅ VALIDATION-SUMMARY.md (complete - task-by-task results with clear attribution)
3. ⏳ CLAUDE-ONLY-COMPARISON.md (pending)
