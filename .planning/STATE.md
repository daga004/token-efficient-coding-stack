# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-12)

**Core value:** Full alignment verification - Every core assumption tested against actual implementation with documented evidence
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Audit Foundation & Traceability

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Audit as separate milestone: Existing PROJECT.md archived, audit gets fresh requirements tracking
- Comprehensive scope: All deferred items under review, not just core claims
- Fix-implementation-first: When assumptions ≠ implementation, fix code not docs
- YOLO execution mode: Fast iteration, report findings at end
- Real API testing required: No theoretical costs allowed

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known gaps requiring verification:**
- Missing WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md (no traceability between promises and delivery)
- Gemini Flash integration theoretical (not actual API execution)
- Token increases on small files (tasks 2.1, 3.1, 4.1) - contradicts "reduces tokens" claim
- Non-Python files use metadata summaries (V2 semantic summaries deferred)
