# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-12)

**Core value:** Full alignment verification - Every core assumption tested against actual implementation with documented evidence
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Audit Foundation & Traceability

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 12 (Audit Foundation & Traceability)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-12 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE reconstruction)

Progress: █░░░░░░░░░ 3% (1/34 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last plan: 2 min (01-01)
- Trend: Initial baseline

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Audit as separate milestone: Existing PROJECT.md archived, audit gets fresh requirements tracking
- Comprehensive scope: All deferred items under review, not just core claims
- Fix-implementation-first: When assumptions ≠ implementation, fix code not docs
- YOLO execution mode: Fast iteration, report findings at end
- Real API testing required: No theoretical costs allowed

**From Phase 1:**
- 15 total promises identified (6 delivered, 3 partial, 2 not delivered, 4 deferred)
- Token reduction target (≥50%) missed - actual 23%
- Cost reduction target (≥70%) exceeded - actual 81%
- 4 critical gaps requiring audit attention

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known gaps requiring verification:**
- ~~Missing WISHLIST-COMPLIANCE.md~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** (created in 01-01)
- Gemini Flash integration theoretical (not actual API execution) - Phase 6
- Token increases on small files (tasks 2.1, 3.1, 4.1) - contradicts "reduces tokens" claim - Phase 7
- Non-Python files use metadata summaries (V2 semantic summaries deferred) - Phase 8
- Small file overhead not handled (auto-detect threshold missing) - Phase 7
